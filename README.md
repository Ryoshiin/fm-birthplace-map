# FM Birthplace Map Generator

This is a silly Streamlit app that lets you upload a Football Manager roster export (HTML or CSV), geocodes each player's birthplace via Nominatim, and displays all birthplaces on a full-width world map.

## Usage

1. Upload your FM export (HTML or CSV).
2. The app automatically geocodes each birth city.
3. View your players on a world map with tooltips showing name + birthplace.

## Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for details.

## To Do
- [ ]  Display a randomly selected house from the playerâ€™s birthplace
- [ ]  Add supports for other languages (currently the exported view has to be set to english)
